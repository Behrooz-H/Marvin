{"name":"Marvin","tagline":"Semantic text annotation tools using Wordnet and DBPedia","body":"# Welcome to Marvin - Semantic text annotator\r\nMarvin is a semantic text annotation tool that uses various external sources to annotate imputed text. Marvin text annotator can be also used as a java library. Marvin currently supports tagging using Wordnet and DBPedia (linked data version of Wikipedia). So our small Marvin semantic annotator already has a lot of knowledge, which will make anyone probably depressed and therefore we gave him a name with reference to Hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy depressed robot. \r\n![Marvin, semantic text annotator](http://lawrencerspencer.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/MARVIN-THE-ROBOT.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nMarvin semantic text annotatior is a java program that can be also used as a java library for other application. This means it is an .jar file, which contains all the resources inside it. However, for use of Wordnet, Wordnet has to be installed from https://wordnet.princeton.edu/wordnet/download/current-version/\r\n\r\nAfter the installation it is necessary to configure Wordnet path in file_properties.xml file. Tag that currently states following:\r\n```\r\n<param name=\"dictionary_path\" value=\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\WordNet\\2.1\\dict\"/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nhas to be changed with the correct path within the machine where Wordnet is installed. There are no other requirements for the installation.\r\n\r\n## Running Marvin semantic text annotator\r\n### Running from the command line\r\nIn order to run Marvin semantic annotator you can type in command line\r\n```\r\njava -jar Marvin.jar \"Sentence to be semantically annotated.\"\r\n```\r\n### Running Marvin semantic text annotator as a library\r\nIn order to run Marvin semantic text annotator as a library, you need to also to install WordNet on a used machine and then include the Marvin.jar file into your Java project. \r\n\r\nThe library contains methods that would query DBPedia and Wordnet and both method return a LinkedList of objects called WordMeaningOutputElement\r\n```\r\npublic class WordMeaningOutputElement {\r\n\tpublic String appearingWord; // what is the word in text\r\n\tpublic String Description; //Definition in Wordnet or abstract from DBPedia\r\n\tpublic String Source; // String Wordnet or DBPedia\r\n\tpublic int startAt; // position where the labelled word starts in your string\r\n\tpublic int endAt; // position where the labelled word ends in your string\r\n\tpublic String id; // id in Wordnet or URI from DBPedia\r\n\tpublic String URL; // link to Wordnet definition of term or DBPedia URI\r\n}\r\n```\r\n## Roadmap\r\nRoadmap of project includes addition of new external sources for semantic tagging. Currently the idea is to include the following:\r\n* Metamap (UMLS tagging, useful in biomedicine)\r\n* Unit ontology\r\n* Possibly other ontologies\r\n\r\n##Reference\r\n\r\nIf you used Marvin, please cite:\r\n \r\n* Marvin: Semantic annotation using multiple knowledge sources, Nikola Milosevic, 2016, arXiv preprint arXiv:1602.00515 (http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1602/1602.00515.pdf)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project was created as a part of Nikola Milosevic's (@nikolamilosevic86) PhD project at the University of Manchester, supervised by dr Goran Nenadic (Univerisity of Manchester), Cassie Gregson (AstraZeneca) and Robert Hernandez (AstraZeneca).\r\nMore information about Nikola you can find at his [web page](http://inspiratron.org) or you may follow him on [twitter](https://twitter.com/dreadknight011)\r\n\r\n## Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with this project?
